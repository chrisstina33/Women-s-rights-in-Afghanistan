  <h2>The Situation of Women in Afghanistan</h2>
  <p><strong>Since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, the situation of women in Afghanistan has significantly worsened, being described by the UN as one of the most repressive in the world.</strong></p>
  

  <h3>Education and Work</h3>
  <p><strong>Girls over the age of 12 have been banned from attending schools and universities. Women are no longer allowed to study in fields such as medicine, dentistry, or nursing. Access to higher education is completely forbidden, which also negatively impacts the healthcare system, where women in some provinces can no longer be treated by male doctors.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Additionally, most women have been prevented from returning to work, including in schools and universities. The Taliban do not support the involvement of women in leadership roles and have used lethal force to disperse protests in favor of women’s rights.</strong></p>

  <h3>Social and Mobility Restrictions</h3>
  <p><strong>Women are not allowed to travel more than 72 kilometers (about 45 miles) without being accompanied by a close male relative. They are also banned from accessing parks, gyms, public baths, and beauty salons. The dress code requires them to wear a burqa or hijab, and women are not allowed to speak loudly in public or be heard from outside their homes.</strong></p>

  <h3>Oppression and Violence</h3>
  <p><strong>The Taliban have abolished legal aid programs and special courts that were designed to fight violence against women and girls. In extreme cases, women have been subjected to sexual violence and torture in prisons. The number of suicides among women has dramatically increased, indicating a severe mental health crisis.</strong></p>

  <h3>The Voices of Afghan Women</h3>
  <p><strong>Zarqa Yaftali, the director of a women’s foundation in Afghanistan, stated: “Afghan women are the ones the world forgets. They are a marginalized group in the country and are the victims of political games. They have no support; right now, they are fighting alone.”</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Despite these restrictions, some women continue to resist by organizing protests and launching underground initiatives to support education and their fundamental rights.</strong></p>

  <h2>Our Project & how it will have an impact</h2>
  <p>This project works with non-governmental organizations that are building educational institutions for Afghan girls and women. These institutions offer scholarships, meals, and educational resources such as books, tablets, laptops, and smartphones. Since education for girls is forbidden in many areas, the use of these items must remain secret to protect them from government retaliation.</p>
  <p>One institute will host 15 girls.</p>

    <h4>We plan to build 10 institutions, meaning 150 girls in total.</h4>
    
    <h5><p class="pretty">The girls will take part in:</p>
    
      <p class="pretty">-Self-defense courses</p>
    
      <p class="pretty">-Academic courses with university professors volunteering their time</p>
    
      <p class="pretty">-Training courses</p></h5>
    
    
    
      <p class="pretty"> A girl who completes the training course will be capable of teaching other girls the subjects learned. She can then reach out to other vulnerable girls, form groups of 15, and teach them the material herself.
